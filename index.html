    <p>Cats are very popular pets and there are many different breeds that all vary in size, colour and markings. An average cat reaches a length of 50-60 cm and weighs about 3-5 kg. The fur may be black, white, brown, grey, red, black and white, tabby (striped) or calico.</p> 
    <h2>Things your cat needs</h2>
  
    <ul>
        <li><strong>food and water</strong> - There are many different sorts of food. Ask your vet or pet shop for assistance. Make sure that your cat always has a bowl of fresh water. Cats never drink where they eat, so put the water bowl at least one metre away from the food bowl.</li>
        <li><strong>a litter box and litter</strong> - Keep the litter box clean or you will soon have some stinky corners in your living room</li>
        <li><strong>a carrier</strong> - You'll have to see the vet from time to time. If you have to transport a cat, always use a carrier.</li>
        <li><strong>a place to sleep</strong> - This can be a fancy cat's bed, the carrier or just an old cushion or blanket.</li>
        <li><strong>toys</strong> - Pet shops have lots of toys for cats, but even rolled-up wads of paper make nice toys. The most important thing is that you take your time to play with your cat.</li>
        <li><strong>a scratching post</strong> - A cat needs to scratch its claws and if you don't have a post, your furniture will suffer.</li>
    </ul>
